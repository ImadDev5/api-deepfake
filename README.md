 DeepGuard: Combating Spam Calls, Deepfake Fraud, and VKYC Exploitation


DeepGuard is an AI-powered solution designed to detect and prevent spam calls, deepfake-based fraud, and exploitation of Video KYC (VKYC) systems in financial services. Built using **AWS services** and **PyTorch**, it provides real-time analysis of video and audio inputs to identify fraudulent activities.

## üöÄ Features

1. **Deepfake Detection**:
   - Analyzes video frames to detect manipulated facial features.
   - Provides a risk score indicating the likelihood of deepfake content.

2. **Voice Fraud Detection**:
   - Transcribes and analyzes audio for phishing attempts and scam keywords.
   - Detects sentiment and identifies flagged keywords (e.g., "OTP", "KYC").

3. **Real-Time Alerts**:
   - Sends alerts for suspicious activities (e.g., deepfake detected, phishing attempt).

4. **VKYC Integrity**:
   - Ensures the authenticity of Video KYC sessions using liveness detection and ID matching.

5. **GDPR Compliance**:
   - Anonymizes sensitive data to protect user privacy.
